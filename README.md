# Churn_Prediction_Model

Client Churn Prediction Model
This project involves analyzing a dataset of 8,000 clients to understand factors influencing churn in a digital advertising platform. The dataset includes key performance metrics such as:

Campaign Performance: Impressions, clicks, calls, web events, and leads.
Financial Data: Budget allocated vs. actual spend.
Client Information: State location and tenure (months as a client).
Churn Indicator: A binary variable (0 = active client, 1 = churned client).
Objective:
The goal is to develop a churn prediction model that estimates the likelihood of a client leaving based on historical performance data. This involves:
âœ… Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Understanding trends, correlations, and distributions.
âœ… Feature Engineering â€“ Creating new variables to enhance model performance.
âœ… Model Development â€“ Using Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost) or R (Caret, Tidyverse) to build predictive models.
âœ… Evaluation & Insights â€“ Interpreting feature importance and providing actionable recommendations.

Since this dataset is mock data from 2023, clients who have been active for all 12 months of 2023 will inherently have a churn indicator of 0, making it important to account for potential bias.

Tools Used:
ðŸ›  Python / R â€“ Data preprocessing, modeling
ðŸ›  SQL / Pandas â€“ Data manipulation, feature engineering
ðŸ›  Excel / Tableau â€“ Exploratory analysis and visualization

While the focus is not on model accuracy due to limited data points, this project aims to showcase the full end-to-end process of building a predictive model, from data cleaning to model deployment.

ðŸ“Œ Next Steps: Explore the dataset, build a baseline model, iterate with feature engineering, and optimize for interpretability. ðŸš€
